Create a comprehensive HTML-only learning module specifically designed for absolute beginners with zero prior coding experience with indonesian language. Structure the content to focus exclusively on fundamental HTML concepts, semantic markup, and proper document structure without introducing any CSS styling or JavaScript functionality. Ensure all examples use clean, semantic HTML5 elements with proper nesting and indentation. Include progressive exercises starting from basic document structure, moving through headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, and forms. Emphasize accessibility best practices, proper attribute usage, and semantic meaning of elements. Provide clear explanations of HTML syntax, tag purposes, and document organization. Design exercises that build upon each other logically, allowing students to create meaningful web content using only HTML markup. Include common beginner mistakes and how to avoid them, proper file naming conventions, and basic project organization. Ensure all code examples are complete, functional HTML documents that can be opened directly in a browser to see immediate results.
